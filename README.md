Quickstart guide for naim-oscar
===============================

Before you begin, you'll need the most recent Luaified naim.  To get that,
clone from [jwise/naim](http://github.com/jwise/naim) and run `autogen.sh`.

Next, check this repo out, and run `install-home.sh`, which installs these
scripts into `~/.naim`.  The old `init.lua` hack is no longer needed.  Then,
`/newconn you OSCAR` and then `/connect` as you would ordinarily.  SSI buddy
list support has become more stable over time, but you should still have a
backup of your buddy list before you connect.

Enjoy!
